## short description of this small project

The Analyzer does a simple overview of your chatting behavior with someone on WhatsApp. This project still may have some messy code so I am really sorry for this.

The file of the chat can be exported in WhatsApp (Android) or directly in WhatsApp Web (right click on chat -> archive chat).

The exported file will have the following layout:

```
18.10.17, 17:10 - Person A: I love programming in Java
18.10.17, 17:37 - Person B: Yeah, it is fun
...
```

The analyziation can be done with creating a WamAnalyzer object:

```
WamAnalyzerImpl analyzer = new WamAnalyzerImpl();
analyzer.analyzeWhatsApp("C:\\Users\\Foo\\Desktop\\ChatWithBar.txt");
```

The program will display graphs as result of the analyzation.
